**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

A pizza restaurant chain wants to understand customer buying patterns,
identify their best-performing products, and optimize their operations.
However, the raw transactional data is scattered across multiple tables
(orders, pizzas, order details, pizza types) and lacks summarized
insights.

Using SQL queries and data visualization, the project aimed to support
data driven decisions for optimizing menu offerings and improving
overall sales strategy.

**Goals:**

1.  Identify the top selling pizzas by quantity and revenue.

2.  Determine the most popular pizza sizes and categories.

3.  Analyze cumulative and daily/monthly revenue trends.

4.  Calculate revenue share by pizza category.

5.  Understand category wise distribution of pizza orders.
